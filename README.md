# ecofriend_smart_light
This was our project for SpeedHacks 2.0, made in 6 hours.
Creates a smart light that only turns on when movement is detected nearby.
The light automatically turns off after a period of time specified by max_time (for demonstration, it is set to 10 seconds).
Information about how long the light has been on is printed to an LCD.
