# ecofriend_smart_light
This was our project for SpeedHacks 2.0, made in 6 hours.
Creates a smart light that only turns on when movement is detected nearby.
The light automatically turns off after a period of time specified by max_time (for demonstration, it is set to 10 seconds).
Information about how long the light has been on is printed to an LCD.

The hardware setup consists of an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a 1602 LCD, an ultrasonic sensor, and a simple LED connected via a breadboard.
